# About Me
* I completed my Phd in Computer Science and Engineering at The Ohio State University. I was very fortunate to be advised by Dr. Raef Bassily. 
* My research includes privacy-preserving data analysis, with a specific focus on differential privacy and its applications to machine learning, optimization, and adaptive data analysis. At OSU, I  worked on differential privacy with my dissertation focussing on tackling some of the fundamental limitations pertaining to the utility of different machine learning algorithms. These limitations arise due to the strict formal gaurantees offered by differential privacy. To circumvent these challenges we pursued two directions: (1) relaxing the model of differentially private learning, and (2) exploiting the geometry of the learning problem.
* Before joining Ohio State, I graduated with a M.Tech from the Department of Computer Science & Engineering at Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati (India) in 2013. I completed my Bachelorâ€™s in Computer Science & Engineering from Sardar Patel University, Gujarat (India) in 2009.
